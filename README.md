# Showdown HTML Escape plugin

This plugin for [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) prevents
the use of arbitrary HTML and allows only the specific Markdown syntax.

This is useful if you want to allow your users to format text using the Markdown
syntax but you do not want them to directly enter HTML.

## Example

```JavaScript
var converter = new showdown.Converter({extensions: ['htmlescape']}),
    input = 'Allows **Markdown markup**, but does not allow <b>HTML markup</b>',
    html = converter.makeHtml(input);
    console.log(html);
```

This should output:
```
<p>Allows <strong>Markdown markup</strong>, but does not allow &lt;b&gt;HTML markup&lt;/b&gt;</p>
```

## Notes on security
This plugin is **not** meant to protect you from XSS attacks, it justs limits
the syntax available to the user to the Markdown specific syntax. If security
and XSS prevention is important for your use case  you still must filter the
HTML generated by Showdown.
See [Markdown's XSS Vulnerability (and how to mitigate it](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Markdown's-XSS-Vulnerability-%28and-how-to-mitigate-it%29)
for details.
